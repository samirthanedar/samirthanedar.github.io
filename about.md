My name is Samir Thanedar. I have been growing startups for the past 6 years as a founder and early employee. More recently, I've worked on several data science projects. In these blog post, I've detailed the process I took on each one and the findings that came from it. To check out the code for any of these projects you can go to [my Github page](https://github.com/samirthanedar).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com).

Thanks for reading!
